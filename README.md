# BusNetwork

Python project I've done in the context of a school project.

I made 100 % of it, from conception to coding.

The goal was to code and implement the Dijkstra algorithm.

There was not many constraints in the project except the main objective :
Make an application to find the shortest trip and the fastest trip from one destination to another.
(and it had to work and show our hability to code in python...).

I decided to use Tkinter for the GUI and I will upload an edited version of the rapport I made accompanying the source code when I will have the time.

This is not my most interesting project but I enjoyed doing it.
